Cmdlets are named according to a verb-noun naming standard. This pattern can help you to understand what they do and to search for them. It also helps cmdlet developers create consistent names. You can see the list of approved verbs by using the `Get-Verb` cmdlet. Verbs are organized by activity type and function. We can filter cmdlets with options: `un*` (starting with *un*), `-Group`, and `-Verb`.

A pipeline is a series of commands connected by pipeline operators (|) (ASCII 124). Each pipeline operator sends the results of the preceding command to the next command.

The output of the first command can be sent for processing as input to the second command. And that output can be sent to yet another command. The result is a complex command chain or pipeline that is composed of a series of simple commands.

For example: `Command-1 | Command-2 | Command-3`.  

In this example, the objects that Command-1 emits are sent to Command-2. Command-2 processes the objects and sends them to Command-3. Command-3 processes the objects and send them down the pipeline. Because there are no more commands in the pipeline, the results are displayed at the console.

In a pipeline, the commands are processed in order from left to right. The processing is handled as a single operation and output is displayed as it's generated.

Here is a simple example. The following command gets the Notepad process and then stops it.

`Get-Process notepad | Stop-Process`.

To support pipelining, the receiving cmdlet must have a parameter that accepts pipeline input. Use the Get-Help command with the Full or Parameter options to determine which parameters of a cmdlet accept pipeline input.

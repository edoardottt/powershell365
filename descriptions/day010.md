The Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE) is a host application for Windows PowerShell. In the ISE, you can run commands and write, test, and debug scripts in a single Windows-based graphic user interface. The ISE provides multiline editing, tab completion, syntax coloring, selective execution, context-sensitive help, and support for right-to-left languages. Menu items and keyboard shortcuts are mapped to many of the same tasks that you would do in the Windows PowerShell console. For example, when you debug a script in the ISE, you can right-click on a line of code in the edit pane to set a breakpoint.
You can open and edit Windows PowerShell files in the Script Pane. Specific file types of interest in Windows PowerShell are script files (.ps1), script data files (.psd1), and script module files (.psm1). These file types are syntax colored in the Script Pane editor. Other common file types you may open in the Script Pane are configuration files (.ps1xml), XML files, and text files.

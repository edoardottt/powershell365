Use the Get-Help core cmdlet to invoke a built-in help system. Or use an alias help command to invoke Get-Help but improve the reading experience by paginating the response. All the options of the command in the reference. If you type Get-Help followed by the exact name of a help article, or by a word unique to a help article, Get-Help displays the article's content. If you specify the exact name of a command alias, Get-Help displays the help for the original command. If you enter a word or word pattern that appears in several help article titles, Get-Help displays a list of the matching titles. If you enter any text that doesn't appear in any help article titles, Get-Help displays a list of articles that include that text in their contents. Get-Help can get help articles for all supported languages and locales. Get-Help first looks for help files in the locale set for Windows, then in the parent locale, such as pt for pt-BR, and then in a fallback locale. Beginning in PowerShell 3.0, if Get-Help doesn't find help in the fallback locale, it looks for help articles in English, en-US, before it returns an error message or displaying autogenerated help.
